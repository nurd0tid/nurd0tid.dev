Tania's personal website running on Gatsby, React, and Node.js.

**Note**: The source for this site is not made to be a template or theme, but for my own use and I am still developing this blog for my portfolio needs, this template itself was inspired by [Tani Rascia.](https://github.com/taniarascia/taniarascia.com) Feel free to take any inspiration from it you want, but this code was not written with the intention of cloning and distributing. Therefore, I do not provide support or guidance to do so. I recommend using the [Gatsby Advanced Starter](https://github.com/vagr9k/gatsby-advanced-starter/) to set up a blog or an existing theme created for that purpose.
